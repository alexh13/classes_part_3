# classes_part_3

What I Learned:

- Building on my previous fraction class assignment, this assignments calls for implimentation of multiple fraction objects. 
I've added iverloading operators, all six relational operators, the four basic arithmetic operators, shorthand arithmetic 
operators and increment decrement operators.

- Define syntactically correct overloaded operators in accordance with good programming practice
- Implement friend functions
